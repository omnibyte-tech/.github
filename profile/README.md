# Welcome to TrackSim!

From the developers behind Prime Logistics, we bring you TrackSim.
A job logging solution for American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 that processes the game data and sends it straight to your Drivers Hub with no fuss!

**Gone are the days of trying to create your own solution...**
We know it's not easy to create your own tracker. That's why we have made this solution so you don't have to worry about creating one.

With TrackSim, we make it simple. Your drivers install our client, you setup the integration to your Drivers Hub and the jobs your drivers log go straight through to your Drivers Hub, no fuss.

**So, how is this different to VTLog, TrucksBook and other solutions?**
VLog and TrucksBook are solutions that are all-in-one Drivers Hub solution which lacks flexibility to customise specifically to your VTC which is inconvenient for those VTs who want that cutting edge. This is where we step in. We provide you with the client and a way to integrate it into your own solution.

**Is this solution best for me?**
TrackSim is for virtual trucking companies that have their own Drivers Hub and need a way to log their drivers jobs onto their platform.

**How much will it cost?**
Our plans are monthly and based around the number of drivers you have within your VTC. You should choose the best plan for you. You can see all our plans below:  
Free Tier: £0 a month (Up to 3 drivers, Limited Features)  
Lite Tier: £3 a month (Up to 25 drivers)  
Standard Tier: £6 a month (Up to 50 drivers)  
Pro Tier: £10 a month (Up to 100 drivers)  
Elite Tier: £15 a month (Up to 500 drivers)  
Enterprise Tier: £30 a month (Unlimited drivers)

*Pricing may vary if purchasing via our partners. Pricing may also change at anytime*

**When are we launching?**
Right now, we are currently in a closed testing stage but our roadmap sees a release before the end of March 2023.
